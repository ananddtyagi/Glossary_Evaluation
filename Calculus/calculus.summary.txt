Wikipedia First Paragraph for "abelian theorem"

In mathematics, Abelian and Tauberian theorems are theorems giving conditions for two methods of summing divergent series to give the same result, named after Niels Henrik Abel and Alfred Tauber. The original examples are Abel's theorem showing that if a series converges to some limit then its Abel sum is the same limit, and Tauber's theorem showing that if the Abel sum of a series exists and the coefficients are sufficiently small (o(1/"n")) then the series converges to the Abel sum. More general Abelian and Tauberian theorems give similar results for more general summation methods.

From file: ./calculus/calculus101.txt3: 
A summability method "M" is regular if it agrees with the actual limit on all convergent series. Such a result is called an Abelian theorem for "M", from the prototypical Abel's theorem. More interesting, and in general more subtle, are partial converse results, called Tauberian theorems, from a prototype proved by Alfred Tauber.

From file: ./calculus/calculus1.txt3: 
In the theory of integral transforms Abelian theorems give the asymptotic behaviour of the transform based on properties of the original function. Conversely Tauberian theorems give the asymptotic behaviour of the original function based on properties of the transform but usually require some restrictions on the original function.

For any summation method "L", its Abelian theorem is the result that if "c" = ("c") is a convergent sequence, with limit "C", then "L"("c") = "C".

From file: ./calculus/calculus235.txt3:  The Laplace transform is usually understood as conditionally convergent, meaning that it converges in the former instead of the latter sense.

The set of values for which converges absolutely is either of the form or else , where is an extended real constant, . (This follows from the dominated convergence theorem.) The constant is known as the abscissa of absolute convergence, and depends on the growth behavior of .

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "leibniz"

Gottfried Wilhelm (von) Leibniz (sometimes spelled Leibnitz) (; or ; ; – 14 November 1716) was a prominent German polymath and one of the most important logicians, mathematicians and natural philosophers of the Enlightenment. As a representative of the seventeenth-century tradition of rationalism, Leibniz's most prominent accomplishment was conceiving the ideas of differential and integral calculus, independently of Isaac Newton's contemporaneous developments. Mathematical works have consistently favored Leibniz's notation as the conventional expression of calculus. It was only in the 20th century that Leibniz's law of continuity and transcendental law of homogeneity found mathematical implementation (by means of non-standard analysis). He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal's calculator, he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685 and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, which is the foundation of all digital computers.

From file: ./calculus/calculus243.txt3: The question was a major intellectual controversy, which began simmering in 1699 and broke out in full force in 1711. Leibniz had published his work first, but Newton's supporters accused Leibniz of plagiarizing Newton's unpublished ideas. Leibniz died in disfavor in 1716 after his patron, the Elector Georg Ludwig of Hanover, became King George I of Great Britain in 1714.

From file: ./calculus/calculus164.txt3: 
In 1708, John Keill, writing in the journal of the Royal Society and with Newton's presumed blessing, accused Leibniz of having plagiarised Newton's calculus. Thus began the calculus priority dispute which darkened the remainder of Leibniz's life.

From file: ./calculus/calculus217.txt3: 
Starting in 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism. The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud; it was later found that Newton wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz.

From file: ./calculus/calculus243.txt3:  His unacknowledged possession of a copy of part of one of Newton's manuscripts may be explicable; but it appears that on more than one occasion, Leibniz deliberately altered or added to important documents (e.g., the letter of 7 June 1713 in the "Charta Volans", and that of 8 April 1716 in the "Acta Eruditorum"), before publishing them, and falsified a date on a manuscript (1675 being altered to 1673). All this casts doubt on his testimony.

Adequality is a technique developed by Pierre de Fermat in his treatise "Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam" (a Latin treatise circulated in France c. 1636) to calculate maxima and minima of functions, tangents to curves, area, center of mass, least action, and other problems in calculus. According to André Weil, Fermat "introduces the technical term adaequalitas, adaequare, etc., which he says he has borrowed from Diophantus. As Diophantus V.11 shows, it means an approximate equality, and this is indeed how Fermat explains the word in one of his later writings." (Weil 1973). Diophantus coined the word παρισότης ("parisotēs") to refer to an approximate equality. Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac translated Diophantus's Greek word into Latin as "adaequalitas". Paul Tannery's French translation of Fermat’s Latin treatises on maxima and minima used the words "adéquation" and "adégaler".

Generally considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying concepts of infinitesimals and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems, including the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, and the area under a parabola.

The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics or the Kerala school was a school of mathematics and astronomy founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama in Kerala, India which included among its members: Parameshvara, Neelakanta Somayaji, Jyeshtadeva, Achyuta Pisharati, Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri and Achyuta Panikkar. The school flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries and the original discoveries of the school seems to have ended with Narayana Bhattathiri (1559–1632). In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently discovered a number of important mathematical concepts. Their most important results—series expansion for trigonometric functions—were described in Sanskrit verse in a book by Neelakanta called "Tantrasangraha", and again in a commentary on this work, called "Tantrasangraha-vakhya", of unknown authorship. The theorems were stated without proof, but proofs for the series for sine, cosine, and inverse tangent were provided a century later in the work "Yuktibhasa" (), written in Malayalam, by Jyesthadeva, and also in a commentary on "Tantrasangraha".

In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or computational differentiation, is a set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program. AD exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original program.

In the special case of a manifold isometrically embedded into a higher-dimensional Euclidean space, the covariant derivative can be viewed as the orthogonal projection of the Euclidean directional derivative onto the manifold's tangent space.

In calculus, a derivative test uses the derivatives of a function to locate the critical points of a function and determine whether each point is a local maximum, a local minimum, or a saddle point. Derivative tests can also give information about the concavity of a function.

Sample Passages mentioning the term:"derivative test higher-order"

From file: ./calculus/calculus73.txt3: As shown below, the second-derivative test is mathematically identical to the special case of "n" = 1 in the higher-order derivative test.

From file: ./calculus/calculus123.txt3: 
One can do this either by evaluating the function at each point and taking the maximum, or by analyzing the derivatives further, using the first derivative test, the second derivative test, or the higher-order derivative test.

From file: ./calculus/calculus73.txt3: 
The "higher-order derivative test" or "general derivative test" is able to determine whether a function's critical points are maxima, minima, or points of inflection for a wider variety of functions than the second-order derivative test.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "descarte"

René Descartes (, , ; Latinized: Renatus Cartesius; adjectival form: "Cartesian" ; 31 March 1596 – 11 February 1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist. A native of the Kingdom of France, he spent about 20 years (1629–1649) of his life in the Dutch Republic after serving for a while in the Dutch States Army of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange and the Stadtholder of the United Provinces. One of the most notable intellectual figures of the Dutch Golden Age, Descartes is also widely regarded as one of the founders of modern philosophy.

From file: ./calculus/calculus222.txt3: Since all attempts to rectify the ellipse and hyperbola had been (necessarily) ineffectual, it had been supposed that no curves could be rectified, as indeed Descartes had definitely asserted to be the case. The logarithmic spiral had been rectified by Evangelista Torricelli and was the first curved line (other than the circle) whose length was determined, but the extension by Neile and Wallis to an algebraic curve was novel.

From file: ./calculus/calculus4.txt3: 
Fermat's method was highly criticized by his contemporaries, particularly Descartes. Victor Katz suggests this is because Descartes had independently discovered the same new mathematics, known as his method of normals, and Descartes was quite proud of his discovery.

From file: ./calculus/calculus177.txt3: In particular, in "Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minima" and in "De tangentibus linearum curvarum", Fermat developed an adequality method for determining maxima, minima, and tangents to various curves that was closely related to differentiation. Isaac Newton would later write that his own early ideas about calculus came directly from "Fermat's way of drawing tangents."

On the integral side, Cavalieri developed his method of indivisibles in the 1630s and 1640s, providing a more modern form of the ancient Greek method of exhaustion, and computing Cavalieri's quadrature formula, the area under the curves "x" of higher degree, which had previously only been computed for the parabola, by Archimedes.

From file: ./calculus/calculus329.txt3: 
In "Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam" and in "De tangentibus linearum curvarum", Fermat developed a method (adequality) for determining maxima, minima, and tangents to various curves that was equivalent to differential calculus. In these works, Fermat obtained a technique for finding the centers of gravity of various plane and solid figures, which led to his further work in quadrature.

Fermat was the first person known to have evaluated the integral of general power functions.

From file: ./calculus/calculus123.txt3: 
Fermat's theorem is central to the calculus method of determining maxima and minima: in one dimension, one can find extrema by simply computing the stationary points (by computing the zeros of the derivative), the non-differentiable points, and the boundary points, and then investigating this set to determine the extrema.

One can do this either by evaluating the function at each point and taking the maximum, or by analyzing the derivatives further, using the first derivative test, the second derivative test, or the higher-order derivative test.

Intuitively, a differentiable function is approximated by its derivative – a differentiable function behaves infinitesimally like a linear function formula_23 or more precisely, formula_24 Thus, from the perspective that "if "f" is differentiable and has non-vanishing derivative at formula_25 then it does not attain an extremum at formula_25" the intuition is that if the derivative at formula_13 is positive, the function is "increasing" near formula_25 while if the derivative is negative, the function is "decreasing" near formula_29 In both cases, it cannot attain a maximum or minimum, because its value is changing.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "diffusion equation"

The diffusion equation is a parabolic partial differential equation. In physics, it describes the macroscopic behavior of many micro-particles in Brownian motion, resulting from the random movements and collisions of the particles (see Fick's laws of diffusion). In mathematics, it is related to Markov processes, such as random walks, and applied in many other fields, such as materials science, information theory, and biophysics. The diffusion equation is a special case of convection–diffusion equation, when bulk velocity is zero.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "dirac delta function"

In mathematics, the Dirac delta function ( function) is a generalized function or distribution introduced by the physicist Paul Dirac. It is used to model the density of an idealized point mass or point charge as a function equal to zero everywhere except for zero and whose integral over the entire real line is equal to one. As there is no function that has these properties, the computations made by the theoretical physicists appeared to mathematicians as nonsense until the introduction of distributions by Laurent Schwartz to formalize and validate the computations. As a distribution, the Dirac delta function is a linear functional that maps every function to its value at zero. The Kronecker delta function, which is usually defined on a discrete domain and takes values 0 and 1, is a discrete analog of the Dirac delta function.

Electromagnetism is a branch of physics involving the study of the electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles. The electromagnetic force is carried by electromagnetic fields composed of electric fields and magnetic fields, and it is responsible for electromagnetic radiation such as light. It is one of the four fundamental interactions (commonly called forces) in nature, together with the strong interaction, the weak interaction, and gravitation. At high energy the weak force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single electroweak force.

In complex analysis, an elliptic function is a meromorphic function that is periodic in two directions. Just as a periodic function of a real variable is defined by its values on an interval, an elliptic function is determined by its values on a fundamental parallelogram, which then repeat in a lattice. Such a doubly periodic function cannot be holomorphic, as it would then be a bounded entire function, and by Liouville's theorem every such function must be constant. In fact, an elliptic function must have at least two poles (counting multiplicity) in a fundamental parallelogram, as it is easy to show using the periodicity that a contour integral around its boundary must vanish, implying that the residues of all simple poles must cancel.

Pierre de Fermat () (between 31 October and 6 December 1607 – 12 January 1665) was a French lawyer at the "Parlement" of Toulouse, France, and a mathematician who is given credit for early developments that led to infinitesimal calculus, including his technique of adequality. In particular, he is recognized for his discovery of an original method of finding the greatest and the smallest ordinates of curved lines, which is analogous to that of differential calculus, then unknown, and his research into number theory. He made notable contributions to analytic geometry, probability, and optics. He is best known for his Fermat's principle for light propagation and his Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory, which he described in a note at the margin of a copy of Diophantus' "Arithmetica".

The interaction of subatomic particles can be complex and difficult to understand; Feynman diagrams give a simple visualization of what would otherwise be an arcane and abstract formula. According to David Kaiser, "Since the middle of the 20th century, theoretical physicists have increasingly turned to this tool to help them undertake critical calculations. Feynman diagrams have revolutionized nearly every aspect of theoretical physics."

The dividend discount model (DDM) is a method of valuing a company's stock price based on the theory that its stock is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments, discounted back to their present value. In other words, it is used to value stocks based on the net present value of the future dividends. The equation most widely used is called the Gordon growth model (GGM). It is named after Myron J. Gordon of the University of Toronto, who originally published it along with Eli Shapiro in 1956 and made reference to it in 1959. Their work borrowed heavily from the theoretical and mathematical ideas found in John Burr Williams 1938 book "The Theory of Investment Value."

Gottfried Wilhelm (von) Leibniz (sometimes spelled Leibnitz) (; or ; ; – 14 November 1716) was a prominent German polymath and one of the most important logicians, mathematicians and natural philosophers of the Enlightenment. As a representative of the seventeenth-century tradition of rationalism, Leibniz's most prominent accomplishment was conceiving the ideas of differential and integral calculus, independently of Isaac Newton's contemporaneous developments. Mathematical works have consistently favored Leibniz's notation as the conventional expression of calculus. It was only in the 20th century that Leibniz's law of continuity and transcendental law of homogeneity found mathematical implementation (by means of non-standard analysis). He became one of the most prolific inventors in the field of mechanical calculators. While working on adding automatic multiplication and division to Pascal's calculator, he was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685 and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. He also refined the binary number system, which is the foundation of all digital computers.

It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "holomorphic function"

In mathematics, a holomorphic function is a complex-valued function of one or more complex variables that is, at every point of its domain, complex differentiable in a neighborhood of the point. The existence of a complex derivative in a neighbourhood is a very strong condition, for it implies that any holomorphic function is actually infinitely differentiable and equal, locally, to its own Taylor series ("analytic"). Holomorphic functions are the central objects of study in complex analysis.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "holonomic function"

In mathematics, and more specifically in analysis, a holonomic function is a smooth function of several variables that is a solution of a system of linear homogeneous differential equations with polynomial coefficients and satisfies a suitable dimension condition in terms of D-modules theory. More precisely, a holonomic function is an element of a holonomic module of smooth functions. Holonomic functions can also be described as differentiably finite functions, also known as D-finite functions. When a power series in the variables is the Taylor expansion of a holonomic function, the sequence of its coefficients, in one or several indices, is also called "holonomic". Holonomic sequences are also called P-recursive sequences: they are defined recursively by multivariate recurrences satisfied by the whole sequence and by suitable specializations of it. The situation simplifies in the univariate case: any univariate sequence that satisfies a linear homogeneous recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients, or equivalently a linear homogeneous difference equation with polynomial coefficients, is holonomic.

From file: ./calculus/calculus254.txt3: Still more general, the annihilator method applies when satisfies a homogeneous linear differential equation, typically, a holonomic function.

From file: ./calculus/calculus254.txt3: Conversely, if the sequence of the coefficients of a power series is holonomic, then the series defines a holonomic function (even if the radius of convergence is zero). There are efficient algorithms for both conversions, that is for computing the recurrence relation from the differential equation, and "vice versa".

A Cartesian coordinate system (, ) is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a set of numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, measured in the same unit of length. Each reference line is called a "coordinate axis" or just "axis" (plural "axes") of the system, and the point where they meet is its "origin", at ordered pair . The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.

In economics, an indifference curve connects points on a graph representing different quantities of two goods, points between which a consumer is "indifferent". That is, any combinations of two products indicated by the curve will provide the consumer with equal levels of utility, and the consumer has no preference for one combination or bundle of goods over a different combination on the same curve. One can also refer to each point on the indifference curve as rendering the same level of utility (satisfaction) for the consumer. In other words, an indifference curve is the locus of various points showing different combinations of two goods providing equal utility to the consumer. Utility is then a device to represent preferences rather than something from which preferences come. The main use of indifference curves is in the representation of potentially observable demand patterns for individual consumers over commodity bundles.

Lawvere and employing the methods of category theory, it views all functions as being continuous and incapable of being expressed in terms of discrete entities. As a theory, it is a subset of synthetic differential geometry.

From file: ./calculus/calculus84.txt3: This means that set-theoretic mathematical arguments only extend to smooth infinitesimal analysis if they are "constructive" (e.g., do not use proof by contradiction). Some regard this disadvantage as a positive thing, since it forces one to find constructive arguments wherever they are available.

The final approach to infinitesimals again involves extending the real numbers, but in a less drastic way.

From file: ./calculus/calculus39.txt3: However, the concept was revived in the 20th century with the introduction of non-standard analysis and smooth infinitesimal analysis, which provided solid foundations for the manipulation of infinitesimals.

From file: ./calculus/calculus217.txt3:  Leibniz's notation and "differential Method", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.

Such a suggestion fails to account for the calculus in Book 1 of Newton's "Principia" itself and in its forerunner manuscripts, such as "De motu corporum in gyrum" of 1684; this content has been pointed out by critics of both Newton's time and modern times.

His work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the "Principia" itself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of "the method of first and last ratios" and explained why he put his expositions in this form, remarking also that "hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles."

Because of this, the "Principia" has been called "a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus" in modern times and in Newton's time "nearly all of it is of this calculus." His use of methods involving "one or more orders of the infinitesimally small" is present in his "De motu corporum in gyrum" of 1684 and in his papers on motion "during the two decades preceding 1684".

The factorization of a linear partial differential operator (LPDO) is an important issue in the theory of integrability, due to the Laplace-Darboux transformations, which allow construction of integrable LPDEs.

From file: ./calculus/calculus3.txt3: 
The integral formula_77 of a real or complex-valued function is said to converge absolutely if formula_78 One also says that formula_79 is absolutely integrable. The issue of absolute integrability is intricate and depends on whether the Riemann, Lebesgue, or Kurzweil-Henstock (gauge) integral is considered; for the Riemann integral, it also depends on whether we only consider integrability in its proper sense (formula_79 and formula_81 both bounded), or permit the more general case of improper integrals. 

As a standard property of the Riemann integral, when formula_82 is a bounded interval, every continuous function is bounded and (Riemann) integrable, and since formula_79 continuous implies formula_84 continuous, every continuous function is absolutely integrable.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "logarithmic scale"

A logarithmic scale (or log scale) is a way of displaying numerical data over a very wide range of values in a compact way—typically the largest numbers in the data are hundreds or even thousands of times larger than the smallest numbers. Such a scale is nonlinear: the numbers 10 and 20, and 90 and 100, are not the same distance apart on a log scale. Rather, the numbers 10 and 100, and 100 and 1000 are equally spaced. Thus moving a set distance along the scale means the number has been "multiplied" by 10 (or some other fixed factor). Often exponential growth curves are displayed on a log scale, otherwise they would increase too quickly to fit within a small graph. Another way to think about it is that the "number of digits" of the data grows at a constant rate.

Mādhava () is one of the primary names of Krishna, the All-attractive. The word "mādhava" in Sanskrit is a vriddhi derivation of the word "madhu" () which means honey. It therefore functions as an adjective describing anything relating to honey or sweetness. By extension, the word describes a person descended from the Madhu clan, just like "rāghava", "yādava" and Kaurava describe a person descended from the Raghu, Yadu and the Kuru clans respectively.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "magnetic field"

A magnetic field is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence of electric charges in relative motion and magnetized materials. A charge that is moving parallel to a current of other charges experiences a force perpendicular to its own velocity. The effects of magnetic fields are commonly seen in permanent magnets, which pull on magnetic materials (such as iron) and attract or repel other magnets. Magnetic fields surround and are created by magnetized material and by moving electric charges (electric currents) such as those used in electromagnets. They exert forces on nearby moving electrical charges and torques on nearby magnets. In addition, a magnetic field that varies with location exerts a force on magnetic materials. Both the strength and direction of a magnetic field vary with location. As such, it is described mathematically as a vector field.

He is perhaps best known today among mathematicians for Mersenne prime numbers, those which can be written in the form for some integer . He also developed Mersenne's laws, which describe the harmonics of a vibrating string (such as may be found on guitars and pianos), and his seminal work on music theory, "Harmonie universelle", for which he is referred to as the "father of acoustics". Mersenne, an ordained priest, had many contacts in the scientific world and has been called "the center of the world of science and mathematics during the first half of the 1600s" and, because of his ability to make connections between people and ideas, "the post-box of Europe".

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "monodromy"

In mathematics, monodromy is the study of how objects from mathematical analysis, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and differential geometry behave as they "run round" a singularity. As the name implies, the fundamental meaning of "monodromy" comes from "running round singly". It is closely associated with covering maps and their degeneration into ramification; the aspect giving rise to monodromy phenomena is that certain functions we may wish to define fail to be "single-valued" as we "run round" a path encircling a singularity. The failure of monodromy can be measured by defining a monodromy group: a group of transformations acting on the data that encodes what does happen as we "run round" in one dimension. Lack of monodromy is sometimes called "polydromy".

In mathematics, the concept of sign originates from the property of every real number being either positive or negative or zero.

Standardization or standardisation is the process of implementing and developing technical standards based on the consensus of different parties that include firms, users, interest groups, standards organizations and governments. Standardization can help maximize compatibility, interoperability, safety, repeatability, or quality. It can also facilitate commoditization of formerly custom processes. In social sciences, including economics, the idea of "standardization" is close to the solution for a coordination problem, a situation in which all parties can realize mutual gains, but only by making mutually consistent decisions. This view includes the case of "spontaneous standardization processes", to produce de facto standards.

As only a small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number. The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows representing any number by a combination of ten basic numerals called digits. In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs).

From file: ./calculus/calculus217.txt3: The author of the manuscript "De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas", sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins in August of that year as "[...] of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things."

From file: ./calculus/calculus177.txt3:  He showed a willingness to view infinite series not only as approximate devices, but also as alternative forms of expressing a term.

Many of Newton's critical insights occurred during the plague years of 1665–1666 which he later described as, "the prime of my age for invention and minded mathematics and [natural] philosophy more than at any time since." It was during his plague-induced isolation that the first written conception of fluxionary calculus was recorded in the unpublished "De Analysi per Aequationes Numero Terminorum Infinitas". In this paper, Newton determined the area under a curve by first calculating a momentary rate of change and then extrapolating the total area.

That Leibniz saw some of Newton's manuscripts had always been likely. In 1849, C. I. Gerhardt, while going through Leibniz's manuscripts, found extracts from Newton's "De Analysi per Equationes Numero Terminorum Infinitas" (published in 1704 as part of the "De Quadratura Curvarum" but also previously circulated among mathematicians starting with Newton giving a copy to Isaac Barrow in 1669 and Barrow sending it to John Collins) in Leibniz's handwriting, the existence of which had been previously unsuspected, along with notes re-expressing the content of these extracts in Leibniz's differential notation.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "objective function"

In mathematical optimization and decision theory, a loss function or cost function is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some "cost" associated with the event. An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function. An objective function is either a loss function or its negative (in specific domains, variously called a reward function, a profit function, a utility function, a fitness function, etc.), in which case it is to be maximized.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "one-dimensional"

In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. Thus a line has a dimension of one (1D) because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on itfor example, the point at 5 on a number line. A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a dimension of two (2D) because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on itfor example, both a latitude and longitude are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a cube, a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional (3D) because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.

Opticks: or, A Treatise of the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light is a book by English natural philosopher Isaac Newton that was published in English in 1704. (A scholarly Latin translation appeared in 1706.) The book analyzes the fundamental nature of light by means of the refraction of light with prisms and lenses, the diffraction of light by closely spaced sheets of glass, and the behaviour of color mixtures with spectral lights or pigment powders. It is considered one of the great works of science in history. "Opticks" was Newton's second major book on physical science. Newton's name did not appear on the title page of the first edition of "Opticks".

Associated with these parameterizations are various "parameters" used in the simplified processes. Examples include the descent rate of raindrops, convective clouds, simplifications of the atmospheric radiative transfer on the basis of atmospheric radiative transfer codes, and cloud microphysics.

Perturbation theory comprises mathematical methods for finding an approximate solution to a problem, by starting from the exact solution of a related, simpler problem. A critical feature of the technique is a middle step that breaks the problem into "solvable" and "perturbation" parts.

A phenomenon (Greek: φαινόμενον, "phainómenon", from the verb φαίνειν, "phainein", to show, shine, appear, to be manifest or manifest itself, plural phenomena) is "an observable fact or event". The term came into its modern philosophical usage through Immanuel Kant, who contrasted it with the noumenon. In contrast to a phenomenon, a noumenon cannot be directly observed. Kant was heavily influenced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in this part of his philosophy, in which phenomenon and noumenon serve as interrelated technical terms. Far predating this, the ancient Greek Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus also used phenomenon and noumenon as interrelated technical terms.

In mathematics, the polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction. The reference point (analogous to the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system) is called the "pole", and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the "polar axis". The distance from the pole is called the "radial coordinate", "radial distance" or simply "radius", and the angle is called the "angular coordinate", "polar angle", or "azimuth". The radial coordinate is often denoted by "r" or "ρ", and the angular coordinate by "φ", "θ", or "t".

In calculus, Taylor's theorem gives an approximation of a "k"-times differentiable function around a given point by a "k"-th order Taylor polynomial. For analytic functions the Taylor polynomials at a given point are finite-order truncations of its Taylor series, which completely determines the function in some neighborhood of the point. It can be thought of as the extension of linear approximation to higher order polynomials, and in the case of "k" equals 2 is often referred to as a "quadratic approximation". The exact content of "Taylor's theorem" is not universally agreed upon.

Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation: "He tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered". Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognizing Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that Hardy said had "defeated him and his colleagues completely", in addition to rediscovering recently proven but highly advanced results.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "ricci calculus"

In mathematics, Ricci calculus constitutes the rules of index notation and manipulation for tensors and tensor fields. It is also the modern name for what used to be called the absolute differential calculus (the foundation of tensor calculus), developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro in 1887–1896, and subsequently popularized in a paper written with his pupil Tullio Levi-Civita in 1900. Jan Arnoldus Schouten developed the modern notation and formalism for this mathematical framework, and made contributions to the theory, during its applications to general relativity and differential geometry in the early twentieth century.

In Riemannian geometry, the scalar curvature (or the Ricci scalar) is the simplest curvature invariant of a Riemannian manifold. To each point on a Riemannian manifold, it assigns a single real number determined by the intrinsic geometry of the manifold near that point. Specifically, the scalar curvature represents the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball in a Riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in Euclidean space. In two dimensions, the scalar curvature is twice the Gaussian curvature, and completely characterizes the curvature of a surface. In more than two dimensions, however, the curvature of Riemannian manifolds involves more than one functionally independent quantity.

In mathematics, a self-adjoint operator (or Hermitian operator) on a finite-dimensional complex vector space "V" with inner product formula_1 is a linear map "A" (from "V" to itself) that is its own adjoint: formula_2 for all vectors v and w. If "V" is finite-dimensional with a given orthonormal basis, this is equivalent to the condition that the matrix of "A" is a Hermitian matrix, i.e., equal to its conjugate transpose "A". By the finite-dimensional spectral theorem, "V" has an orthonormal basis such that the matrix of "A" relative to this basis is a diagonal matrix with entries in the real numbers. In this article, we consider generalizations of this concept to operators on Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimension.

A stochastic differential equation (SDE) is a differential equation in which one or more of the terms is a stochastic process, resulting in a solution which is also a stochastic process. SDEs are used to model various phenomena such as unstable stock prices or physical systems subject to thermal fluctuations. Typically, SDEs contain a variable which represents random white noise calculated as the derivative of Brownian motion or the Wiener process.

Distributions (or generalized functions) are objects that generalize the classical notion of functions in mathematical analysis. Distributions make it possible to differentiate functions whose derivatives do not exist in the classical sense. In particular, any locally integrable function has a distributional derivative. Distributions are widely used in the theory of partial differential equations, where it may be easier to establish the existence of distributional solutions than classical solutions, or appropriate classical solutions may not exist. Distributions are also important in physics and engineering where many problems naturally lead to differential equations whose solutions or initial conditions are distributions, such as the Dirac delta function.

Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass ( ; 31 October 1815 – 19 February 1897) was a German mathematician often cited as the "father of modern analysis". Despite leaving university without a degree, he studied mathematics and trained as a teacher, eventually teaching mathematics, physics, botany and gymnastics.

Sample Passages mentioning the term:"weierstrass"

From file: ./calculus/calculus310.txt3: Karl Weierstrass formalized the concept of limit in the context of a (real) number system without infinitesimals. Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common to base calculus on ε, δ arguments instead of infinitesimals.

From file: ./calculus/calculus120.txt3: Both proofs involved what is known today as the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem. The result was also discovered later by Weierstrass in 1860.

From file: ./calculus/calculus383.txt3: Tests for uniform convergence include the Weierstrass' M-test, Abel's uniform convergence test, Dini's test, and the Cauchy criterion.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "weierstrass substitution"

In integral calculus, the Weierstrass substitution is a method for evaluating integrals which converts a rational function involving sines and cosines of formula_1 into an ordinary rational function of formula_2 by setting formula_3. No generality is lost by taking these to be rational functions of the sine and cosine. Michael Spivak wrote that this method was the "sneakiest substitution" in the world.

From file: ./calculus/calculus205.txt3: 
The integral can also be derived by using the a somewhat non-standard version of the Weierstrass substitution, which is simpler in the case of this particular integral, published in 2013, is as follows:

From file: ./calculus/calculus242.txt3: 
Given formula_162, this integral reduction formula can be used to compute all of the values of formula_163 for formula_164. Integrals like formula_131 and formula_166 may also be handled using the Weierstrass substitution.

From file: ./calculus/calculus427.txt3: 
The last substitution is known as the Weierstrass substitution, which makes use of tangent half-angle formulas.

From file: ./calculus/calculus120.txt3: Then, for every natural number formula_52, there exists an formula_53 such that formula_54. This defines a sequence formula_55. Because formula_2 is bounded, the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem implies that there exists a convergent subsequence formula_57 of formula_58. Denote its limit by formula_59.

From file: ./calculus/calculus158.txt3: 
This can be seen easily from the fact that the sequences do converge to a common limit (which can be shown by Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem) and the fact that geometric mean is preserved:

From file: ./calculus/calculus120.txt3: Both proofs involved what is known today as the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem. The result was also discovered later by Weierstrass in 1860.

Wikipedia First Paragraph for "wiener process"

In mathematics, the Wiener process is a real valued continuous-time stochastic process named in honor of American mathematician Norbert Wiener for his investigations on the mathematical properties of the one-dimensional Brownian motion. It is often also called Brownian motion due to its historical connection with the physical process of the same name originally observed by Scottish botanist Robert Brown. It is one of the best known Lévy processes (càdlàg stochastic processes with stationary independent increments) and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, economics, quantitative finance, evolutionary biology, and physics.

From file: ./calculus/calculus359.txt3: The average fitness of the types formula_23. The Wiener processes are assumed to be uncorrelated. For formula_24, Itô's lemma then gives us:formula_25The partial derivatives are then:formula_26where formula_27 is the Kronecker delta function.

From file: ./calculus/calculus401.txt3: Typically, SDEs contain a variable which represents random white noise calculated as the derivative of Brownian motion or the Wiener process. However, other types of random behaviour are possible, such as jump processes.

From file: ./calculus/calculus400.txt3: Since the 1970s, the Wiener process has been widely applied in financial mathematics and economics to model the evolution in time of stock prices and bond interest rates.

Thus, what is explicitly Madhava's work is a source of some debate. The "Yukti-dipika" (also called the "Tantrasangraha-vyakhya"), possibly composed by Sankara Variyar, a student of Jyeṣṭhadeva, presents several versions of the series expansions for sin"θ", cos"θ", and arctan"θ", as well as some products with radius and arclength, most versions of which appear in Yuktibhāṣā.

From file: ./calculus/calculus280.txt3: 
Madhava's arctangent series is stated in verses 2.206 – 2.209 in "Yukti-dipika" commentary ("Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya") by Sankara Variar. A translation of the verses is given below.

From file: ./calculus/calculus288.txt3: It comes 22 years before the first proof of the prime number theorem which, by contrast, relies on a careful analysis of the behavior of the Riemann zeta function as a function of a complex variable.

From file: ./calculus/calculus94.txt3: For example, the DGF of the first of these functions is expressed as the product of the Riemann zeta function and the prime zeta function for any complex "s" with formula_34:

From file: ./calculus/calculus94.txt3: 
Dirichlet series play a variety of important roles in analytic number theory. The most usually seen definition of the Riemann zeta function is a Dirichlet series, as are the Dirichlet L-functions. It is conjectured that the Selberg class of series obeys the generalized Riemann hypothesis.
