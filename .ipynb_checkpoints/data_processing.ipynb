The pentode (called a \"triple-grid amplifier\" in some early literature) was developed from the tetrode tube by the addition of a third grid, the suppressor grid. This served to prevent secondary emission electrons emitted by the plate from reaching the screen grid, which caused instability and parasitic oscillations in the tetrode. The pentode is closely related to the beam tetrode. Pentodes were widely used in industrial and consumer electronic equipment such as radios and televisions until the 1960s, when they were replaced by transistors.

Some power supplies are separate standalone pieces of equipment, while others are built into the load appliances that they power. Examples of the latter include power supplies found in desktop computers and consumer electronics devices. Other functions that power supplies may perform include limiting the current drawn by the load to safe levels, shutting off the current in the event of an electrical fault, power conditioning to prevent electronic noise or voltage surges on the input from reaching the load, power-factor correction, and storing energy so it can continue to power the load in the event of a temporary interruption in the source power (uninterruptible power supply).',\n",

       " 'quadratic function': 'in algebra, a quadratic function, a quadratic polynomial, a polynomial of degree 2, or simply a quadratic, is a polynomial function with one or more variables in which the highest-degree term is of the second degree. for example, a quadratic function in three variables x, y, and z contains exclusively terms x2, y2, z2, xy, xz, yz, x, y, z, and a constant:f(x,y,z)=ax2+by2+cz2+dxy+exz+fyz+gx+hy+iz+j,{\\\\displaystyle f(x,y,z)=ax^{2}+by^{2}+cz^{2}+dxy+exz+fyz+gx+hy+iz+j,}with at least one of the coefficients a, b, c, d, e, or f of the second-degree terms being non-zero.a univariate (single-variable) quadratic function has the form[78]f(x)=ax2+bx+c,a≠0{\\\\displaystyle f(x)=ax^{2}+bx+c,\\\\quad a\\\\neq 0}in the single variable x. the graph of a univariate quadratic function is a parabola whose axis of symmetry is parallel to the y-axis, as shown at right.if the quadratic function is set equal to zero, then the result is a quadratic equation. the solutions to the univariate equation are called the roots of the univariate function.the bivariate case in terms of variables x and y has the formf(x,y)=ax2+by2+cxy+dx+ey+f{\\\\displaystyle f(x,y)=ax^{2}+by^{2}+cxy+dx+ey+f\\\\,\\\\!}with at least one of a, b, c not equal to zero, and an equation setting this function equal to zero gives rise to a conic section (a circle or other ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola).in general there can be an arbitrarily large number of variables, in which case the resulting surface is called a quadric, but the highest degree term must be of degree 2, such as x2, xy, yz, etc.',\n",
