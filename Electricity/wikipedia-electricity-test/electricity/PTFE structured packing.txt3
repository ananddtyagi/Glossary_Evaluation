PTFE structured packing

PTFE Structured Packing refers to a range of specially designed materials for use in absorption and distillation columns and chemical reactors. PTFE Structured packing typically consist of thin corrugated PTFE Sheets arranged in a way that they force fluids to take complicated paths through the column, thereby creating a large surface area for contact between different phases. The most common packing materials for plunger packing are PTFE, graphite, and kevlar.
