CAIDI

The Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI) is a reliability index commonly used by electric power utilities. It is related to SAIDI and SAIFI, and is calculated as

formula_1

where formula_2 is the failure rate, formula_3 is the number of customers, and formula_4 is the annual outage time for location formula_5. In other words,

formula_6

CAIDI gives the average outage duration that any given customer would experience. CAIDI can also be viewed as the average restoration time.

CAIDI is measured in units of time, often minutes or hours. It is usually measured over the course of a year, and according to IEEE Standard 1366-1998 the median value for North American utilities is approximately 1.36 hours.
