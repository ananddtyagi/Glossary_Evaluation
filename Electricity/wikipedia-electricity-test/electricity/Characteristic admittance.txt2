Characteristic admittance

Characteristic admittance is the mathematical inverse of the characteristic impedance.
The general expression for the characteristic admittance of a transmission line is:

where

The current and voltage phasors on the line are related by the characteristic admittance as:
where the superscripts formula_9 and formula_10 represent forward- and backward-traveling waves, respectively.
