SAIDI

The System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) is commonly used as a reliability indicator by electric power utilities. SAIDI is the average outage duration for each customer served, and is calculated as:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the number of customers and formula_3 is the annual outage time for location formula_4, and formula_5 is the total number of customers served. In other words,

formula_6

SAIDI is measured in units of time, often minutes or hours. It is usually measured over the course of a year, and according to IEEE Standard 1366-1998 the median value for North American utilities is approximately 1.50 hours.
