Electrical junction

An electrical junction is a point or area where multiple conductors or semiconductors make physical contact. Electrical junctions types include thermoelectricity junctions, metal–semiconductor junctions and p–n junctions. Junctions are either rectifying or non-rectifying. Non-rectifying junctions are called ohmic contacts. Electronic components employing rectifying junctions include p–n diodes, Schottky diodes and bipolar junction transistors.
