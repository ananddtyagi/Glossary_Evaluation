Home idle load

Home idle load is the continuous residential electric energy consumption as measured by smart meters. It differs from standby power (loads) in that it includes energy consumption by devices that cycle on and off within the hourly period of standard smart meters (such as fridges, aquarium heaters, wine coolers, etc.). As such, home idle loads can be measured accurately by smart meters. According to Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab, home idle load constitutes an average of 32% of household electricity consumption in the U.S.

The primary categories of devices that contribute to Home Idle Load include:

Approaches to reduce home idle loads include:

Home idle load may be measured differently depending on the electric meter and local utility used. A smart meter with a local utility that supports “green button” data is the most accurate option to measure home idle load. Another option involves using the user’s utility website to access consumption charts showing hourly electric use. If green button data is not available, the user may measure home idle load by analysing the home’s electric meter while all home electronic devices are in innactive mode. This may involve using a timer to track the time for a single revolution of the spinning dial of an analog electric meter.
