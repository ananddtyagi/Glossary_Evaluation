Electrical interconnector

An electrical interconnector is a high power AC or DC connection, typically across national borders or between different electrical grids. They can be formed of submarine power cables or underground power cables or overhead power lines.

The longest interconnection at 2016 was the undersea NorNed link between Norway and the Netherlands, spanning nearly 600 km and delivering 700 MW of high voltage direct current power.
