Rating (electrical)

The Rating of an electrical appliance indicates the voltage at which the appliance is designed to work and the current consumption at that voltage. These figures are usually displayed on a "rating plate" attached to the appliance, e.g. 230 volts, 3 amperes.

The rating of the appliance is related the power it consumes. Power is measured in watts and is the product of volts and amperes. The example above would have a rating of 690 watts.
