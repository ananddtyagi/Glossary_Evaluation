Magnetic capacitance

Magnetic capacitance (capacitive magnetic reactance) (SI Unit: -Ω) is a magnetic "reactance" which prevents magnetic "current" in oscillating magnetic circuits from rising. This is associated with high reluctance.

For harmonic regimes it is equal to:

Where:

In complex form it is written as an imaginary number:

The electrical potential energy sustained by magnetic capacitivity varies with the frequency of oscillations in magnetic fields. The average power in a given period is equal to zero. The magnetic capacitance is a reactive part of the magnetic circuit.
