Electrically conductive adhesive

An electrically conductive adhesive is a glue that is primarily used for electronics.

The electric conductivity is caused by a component that makes ca. 80% of the total mass of an electrically conductive adhesive. This conductive component is suspended in a sticky component that holds the electrically conductive adhesive together. The particles of the conductive component are in contact to each other and in this way make electric current possible.

The conductive component can be silver, nickel, copper or graphite. Other conductive materials are possible but unusual. The adhesive component can be a varnish, synthetic resin, or Silicone. Variations in conductive component's type and concentration change the resistivity of the adhesive . A typical silver-based conductive adhesive such as that made by Electrolube contains ingredients in the following proportions:-
