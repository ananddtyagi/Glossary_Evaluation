Node (circuits)

In electrical engineering, a node is any point on a circuit where the terminals of two or more circuit elements meet. In circuit diagrams, connections are ideal wires with zero resistance, so a node may consist of the entire section of wire between elements, not just a single point.

According to Ohm's law, "V = IR", the voltage across any two points of a node with negligible resistance is

showing that the voltage at every point of a node is the same. However, there are some notable exceptions where the voltage difference is large enough to become significant:

Dots used to mark nodes on a circuit diagram are sometimes referred to as "meatballs".
