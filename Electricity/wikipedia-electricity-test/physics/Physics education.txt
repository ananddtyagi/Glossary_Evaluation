Physics education

Physics education or physics education research (PER) refers both to the methods currently used to teach physics and to an area of pedagogical research that seeks to improve those methods. Historically, physics has been taught at the high school and college level primarily by the lecture method together with laboratory exercises aimed at verifying concepts taught in the lectures. These concepts are better understood when lectures are accompanied with demonstration, hand-on experiments, and questions that require students to ponder what will happen in an experiment and why. Students who participate in active learning for example with hands-on experiments learn through self-discovery. By trial and error they learn to change their preconceptions about phenomena in physics and discover the underlying concepts.

Aristotle wrote what is considered now as the first textbook of physics. Aristotle's ideas were taught unchanged until the Late Middle Ages, when scientists started making discoveries that didn't fit them. For example, Copernicus' discovery contradicted Aristotle's idea of an Earth-centric universe. Aristotle's ideas about motion weren't displaced until the end of the 17th century, when Newton published his ideas.

Today's physics students keep thinking of physics concepts in Aristotelian terms, despite being taught only Newtonian concepts.

Physics is taught in high schools, college and graduate schools. In the US, it has traditionally not been introduced until junior or senior year (i.e. 11th/12th), and then only as an elective or optional science course, which the majority of American high school students have not taken. Recently in the past years, many students have been taking it their sophomore year.

Physics First is a popular and relatively new movement in American high schools. In schools with this curriculum 9th grade students take a course with introductory physics education. This is meant to enrich students understanding of physics, and allow for more detail to be taught in subsequent high school biology, and chemistry classes; it also aims to increase the number of students who go on to take 12th grade physics or AP Physics (both of which are generally electives in American high schools.) But many scientists and educators argue that freshmen do not have an adequate background in mathematics to be able to fully comprehend a complete physics curriculum, and that therefore quality of a physics education is lost. While physics requires knowledge of vectors and some basic trigonometry, many students in the Physics First program take the course in conjunction with Geometry. They suggest that instead students first take biology and chemistry which are less mathematics-intensive so that by the time they are in their junior year, students will be advanced enough in mathematics with either an Algebra 2 or pre-calculus education to be able to fully grasp the concepts presented in physics. Some argue this even further, saying that at least calculus should be a prerequisite for physics.

Undergraduate physics curricula in American universities includes courses for students choosing an academic major in physics, as well as for students majoring in other disciplines for whom physics courses provide essential prerequisite skills and knowledge. The term "physics major" can refer to the academic major in physics or to a student or graduate who has chosen to major in physics.

Physics courses for non-science majors in the university are usually survey-type courses. The topics covered in courses varies widely, but they are covered shallowly in comparison to more specialized classes for physics majors. Lectures in this area often involve physical demonstrations that aid in the understanding of course material that may be difficult to understand. Students do not need to know how to use formulas requiring advanced mathematics. The content of the course typically requires the use of basic algebra. Tangible applications of course material is typically emphasized. Some courses involve a laboratory component in addition to a lecture portion. The content of the laboratory is usually related to the content of the lecture. Laboratory study gives students experience in doing hands on work with topics covered in lecture. Often labs are administered in a proctored environment, with instructors or assistants providing support and direction to students. 

Physics courses for science or engineering majors usually explore deeper than the survey courses. The content of each individual course might not have as great of scope as survey-type courses, but the greater depth in each topic provides added instruction in areas specific to the students' curriculum. Physics courses for science majors typically have more advanced prerequisite mathematics courses that allows topics within physics to be explored on a more mathematical level. Common prerequisite courses include calculus and differential equations. Teaching in these courses often involves utilizing mathematics to derive formulas, leading to a more mathematical understanding of the physics being taught. 

The courses for physics majors are typically more advanced than those two case that had been talked above. At the beginning of the college. Their courses have few difference with the physics courses for the general education of science major. After the first year, the physics majors need to go up and study many deeper knowledge. The first change of the course is that the scale of the courses is much more smaller than before due to the different major of students in high grade. And for the content of the course, the quantitative analysis is really important. Meanwhile, there is usually a solid of homework. The grades of the students are largely decided by the homework and exams. The non-academic part, such as particitation, discussion, would have little weight. Each year, there are some specific required courses. But students usually can make some change due to their own ability. Students who are enthusiastic can take the graduate level course in senior year.  There are also some purely lab courses, which teach students how to do the advanced experiment and write the lab report.

Teaching strategies are the various techniques used by the teachers to facilitate the students with different learning styles.
The different teaching strategies help teachers to develop critical thinking among students and effectively engaging them in the classroom.
The selection of teaching strategies depends on the concept to be taught and also on the interest of the students.

Methods/Approaches for teaching physics

Approximately eighty-five institutions in the United States conduct research in science and physics education. One primary goal of physics education research is to develop pedagogical techniques and strategies that will help students learn physics more effectively and help instructors to implement these techniques. Owing to the abstract and counter-intuitive nature of many of the elementary concepts in physics, together with the fact that teaching through analogies can lead to didaskalogenic confusions, the lecture method often fails to help students overcome the many misconceptions about the physical world that they have developed before undertaking formal instruction in the subject. Research often focuses on learning more about the common misconceptions (see Scientific misconceptions) that students bring to the physics classroom, so that techniques can be devised to help students overcome these misconceptions.

In most introductory physics courses mechanics usually is the first area of physics that is discussed, and Newton's laws of motion, which describe how massive objects respond to forces, are central to the study of mechanics. As an example, many students hold the Aristotelian misconception that a net force is required to keep a body moving; instead, motion is modelled in modern physics with the Newton's First Law of inertia, stating that a body will keep its state of rest or movement unless a net force acts on the body. Newton arrived at his three laws of motion from an extensive study of empirical data including many astronomical observations. In an active learning environment students might experiment with objects in an environment that has almost no friction, for example a block moving on an almost frictionless air table. There they would find that if they start the block moving at constant speed, it continues to move at constant speed without the need for a constant "push". It is hoped that exercises of this nature will help students to overcome their preconceived ideas about motion.

A variety of interactive learning methods (sometimes also called active learning methods) and laboratory experiences have been developed with this aim. The recognition of the value of interactive engagement over more passive lecturing strategies has been promoted in large measure through studies initially using the Force Concept Inventory.

Dahncke et al. (2001) argued that there is a split in the science education community. On the one hand the major focus in on science whereby the group is usually organized close to the domain discipline, like physical societies. On the other hand, there are science educators whose aims are to balance the domain and educational issues.
 Philosophy of physics ---------Physics---------History of physics

The broad goal of the physics education research (PER) community is to understand the processes involved in the teaching and learning of physics through rigorous scientific investigation.

According to the University of Washington PER group (one of the pioneers in the field), work within PER tends to fall within one or more of several broad descriptions, including:

“An Introduction to Physics Education Research”, by Robert Beichner, identified 8 trends in PER as follows

 which builds off of deductive reasoning research started by Wason and Johnson-Laird.

Physics education research papers in the United States are primarily issued among four publishing venues (Hsu et al. 2007). Papers submitted to the "American Journal of Physics: Physics Education Research Section (PERS)" are mostly to consumers of physics education research (e.g., those for whom interest is in reading about and using it rather than those whose interest is in conducting the research; to the "Journal of the Learning Sciences" (JLS) for whom attention is addressed in real-life or non-laboratory environments often in the context of today's technological society, and about learning, not teaching. Manuscripts sent to "" (PRST:PER) are aimed at those for whom research is conducted on PER rather than to consumers. The audience for "Physics Education Research Conference Proceedings" (PERC) is designed for a mix of consumers and researchers. The latter provides a snapshot of the field and as such is open to preliminary results and research in progress, as well as papers that would simply be thought-provoking to the PER community. Other journals include but are not limited to "Physics Education" (UK), the "European Journal of Physics" (UK), and the "Physics Teacher". Leon Hsu et al. published an article about publishing and refereeing papers in physics education research in 2007.
