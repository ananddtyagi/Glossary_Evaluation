The Boltzmann Medal (or Boltzmann Award) is a prize awarded to physicists that obtain new results concerning statistical mechanics; it is named after the celebrated physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. The Boltzmann Medal is awarded once every three years by the "Commission on Statistical Physics of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics", during the STATPHYS conference.

The award consists of a gilded medal; its front carries the inscription "Ludwig Boltzmann, 1844--1906".

All the winners are influential physicists or mathematicians whose contribution to statistical physics have been relevant in the past decades. Institution with multiple recipients are Sapienza University of Rome (3) and École Normale Supérieure, Cornell University, University of Cambridge (2).
