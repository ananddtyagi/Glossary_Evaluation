Jacques Herbrand Prize

The Jacques Herbrand Prize (French: Prix Jacques Herbrand) is an award given by the French Academy of Sciences to young researchers (up to 35 years) in the field of mathematics, physics, and their non-military applications.
It was created in 1996, and first awarded in 1998.
In 2001, it was renamed to Grand Prix Jacques Herbrand .
Until 2002, the prize was given each year in both fields; since 2003, it is given alternatingly.
It is endowed with 15000, later with 20000 euros, and named in honor of the French logician Jacques Herbrand (1908-1931).
