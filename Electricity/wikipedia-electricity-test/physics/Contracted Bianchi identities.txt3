Contracted Bianchi identities

In general relativity and tensor calculus, the contracted Bianchi identities are:

where formula_2 is the Ricci tensor, formula_3 the scalar curvature, and formula_4 indicates covariant differentiation.

A proof can be found in the entry Proofs involving covariant derivatives.

These identities are named after Luigi Bianchi, although they had been already derived by Aurel Voss in 1880.
