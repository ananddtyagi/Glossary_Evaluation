H. C. Ørsted Medal

The H. C. Ørsted Medal is a medal for scientific achievement awarded by the Danish "Selskabet for naturlærens udbredelse" (The Society for the Dissemination of Natural Science). Named for the society's founder Hans Christian Ørsted, it is awarded chiefly to Danes. The medal is awarded in three versions: gold is for outstanding original scientific work in physics or chemistry published during the previous year; silver is for outstanding writing of science for a popular audience over several years; and bronze is for outstanding popularization of science through non-written methods, such as in museums or through business.
