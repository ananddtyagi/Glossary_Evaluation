Solid light

Solid light, often referred to in media as "Hard Light" or "Hard-light", is a hypothetical material, made of light in a solidified state. Theoretically, it is possible to make such a material, and there are claims this material was already made, including claims from MIT and Harvard.

In theory, photons, the particles that make light, could be attracted in a nonlinear medium. In test, a laser beam fired into an extremely cold cloud of rubidium slowed down the photons and made them act as a single entity.

Solid light appears in many video game franchises, including "Halo", "Portal", "Mass Effect" and "Overwatch". It is also portrayed in "The Lightbringer" series by fantasy author Brent Weeks.
It also appears in Dr. Strange. 

The Gems, a fictional alien race featured in "Steven Universe", are gemstones that project physical bodies made of solid light.

In the webseries RWBY, the character Velvet Scarlatina uses a handheld camera to 3D-print photographed weapons, made out of hard-light Dust.
