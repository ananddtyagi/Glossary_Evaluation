Henri Poincaré Prize

The Henri Poincaré Prize sponsored by the Daniel Iagolnitzer Foundation was created in 1997 to recognize outstanding contributions in mathematical physics, and contributions which lay the groundwork for novel developments in this broad field. The Prize is also created to recognize and support young people of exceptional promise who have already made outstanding contributions to the field of mathematical physics. The prize is awarded to three individuals every three years at the International Congress on Mathematical Physics. The prize committee is appointed by the International Association of Mathematical Physics (IAMP).
