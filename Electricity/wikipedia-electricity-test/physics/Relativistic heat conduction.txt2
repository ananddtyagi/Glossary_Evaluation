Relativistic heat conduction

Relativistic heat conduction refers to the modelling of heat conduction (and similar diffusion processes) in a way compatible with special relativity. This article discusses models using a wave equation with a dissipative term.

Ali and Zhang claim their model of relativistic heat conduction is the only one compatible with the theory of special relativity, the second law of thermodynamics, electrodynamics, and quantum mechanics, simultaneously. The main features of their model are:


These outcomes are achieved by (1) upgrading the Fourier equation of heat conduction to the form of a Telegraph equation of electrodynamics, and (2) introducing a new definition of the heat flux vector. Consequently, their model gives rise to a number of phenomena, such as thermal resonance and thermal shock waves, which are possible during high-frequency pulsed laser heating of thermal insulators.

For most of the last two centuries, heat conduction has been modelled by the well-known Fourier equation:

where "θ" is temperature, "t" is time, "α" = "k"/("ρ" "c") is thermal diffusivity, "k" is thermal conductivity, "ρ" is density, and "c" is specific heat capacity. The Laplace operator,formula_2, is defined in Cartesian coordinates as

This Fourier equation can be derived by substituting Fourier’s linear approximation of the heat flux vector, q, as a function of temperature gradient,

into the first law of thermodynamics

where the del operator, ∇, is defined in 3D as

It can be shown that this definition of the heat flux vector also satisfies the second law of thermodynamics,

where "s" is specific entropy and "σ" is entropy production. Alternatively, the second law can be written as

which leads to the condition

which is always true, because "k" is a non-negative material property.

It is well known that the Fourier equation (and the more general Fick's law of diffusion) is incompatible with the theory of relativity for at least one reason: it admits infinite speed of propagation of heat signals within the continuum field. For example, consider a pulse of heat at the origin; then according to Fourier equation, it is felt (i.e. temperature changes) at any distant point, instantaneously. The speed of information propagation is faster than the speed of light in vacuum, which is inadmissible within the framework of relativity.

To overcome this contradiction, workers such as Cattaneo, Vernotte, Chester, and others proposed that Fourier equation should be upgraded from the parabolic to a hyperbolic form,

In this equation, "C" is called the speed of second sound (i.e. the fictitious quantum particles, phonons). The equation is known as the hyperbolic heat conduction (HHC) equation. Mathematically, it is the same as the telegrapher's equation, which is derived from Maxwell’s equations of electrodynamics.

For the HHC equation to remain compatible with the first law of thermodynamics, it is necessary to modify the definition of heat flux vector, q, to

where formula_12 is a relaxation time, such that formula_13

The most important implication of the hyperbolic equation is that by switching from a parabolic (dissipative) to a hyperbolic (includes a conservative term) partial differential equation, there is the possibility of phenomena such as thermal resonance and thermal shock waves.


Ali and Zhang's theory of RHC attempts to resolve the controversies surrounding the hyperbolic equation, while maintaining the form of that equation. This is achieved by:

In a Euclidean space, distance between any two points, "ds", is measured by

where "dx", "dy", and "dz" are displacements along three orthogonal axes.

In a Minkowski space, distance between two events, "ds", is measured by

where, "τ", is space-like-time and is related to real time, "t", by

where "C" is speed of light in vacuum and formula_19. Hence,

Consequently, the 3D del, ∇,operator is upgraded to the 4D quad, formula_21, operator (also known as the Four-gradient)

Likewise, the 3D Laplacian, formula_2, operator is upgraded to the 4D d'Alembert operator, formula_24

Any physical quantity that is Galilean invariant in Euclidean space can be made Lorentz invariant in a Minkowski space, by upgrading from 3D to 4D operators. Consequently, Fourier’s equation can be upgraded to 4D as

which is called the relativistic heat conduction equation. Likewise, the definition of the heat-flux vector, q, is upgraded to the 4D form as

It can be shown that this definition of q is compatible with the first law of thermodynamics,

as well as the second law of thermodynamics,

in their 4D upgraded form. The imaginary terms in these equations are direct manifestation of the wave nature of heat, and are essential for the heat equation to become compatible with all laws of physics. The real terms in these equations are identical to those in the classical heat model.

It has been observed that RHC reduces the second law of thermodynamics to a statement of the form

which is the "no action at a distance" principle of special relativity. Essentially, the RHC asserts that relativity and the second law of thermodynamics are two alternative, but equal statements about the nature of time. Both physical principles are mutually derivable from each other and are complementary.

As far as heat conduction is concerned, the RHC equation is identical in form to the hyperbolic equation, and all analytical and experimental results that are relevant to one are equally applicable to the other. The definition of heat flux vector, however, is different; but the RHC definition is merely a 4D upgrade of the original linear Fourier approximation. The mathematics of RHC is much simpler and more elegant. However, RHC raises some significant conceptual challenges:


In summary, while the RHC is mathematically simple and elegant, and experimentally practical and relevant, it raises a number of conceptual issues that are highly controversial.

The RHC theory is applicable for any physical problem in which the hyperbolic equation is relevant: when speed of heat propagation is small, e.g. thermal insulators, or when speed of heat-flux variation is very large, e.g. pulsed-laser heating. Applications for those types of problems are abundant, and there is plenty of published work (see "Notes", below). Most of these results remain relevant to RHC, but because the definition of heat flux vector is different, final closed-form solutions may not be the same. In many cases, RHC provides closed-form solutions that are not possible using the HHC model. A number of useful fundamental solutions for 1D and 2D relativistic moving heat sources are available in closed-form.
