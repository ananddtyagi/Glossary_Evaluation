Green's function number

In mathematical heat conduction, the Green's function number is used to uniquely categorize certain fundamental solutions of the heat equation to make existing solutions easier to identify, store, and retrieve.

Numbers have long been used to identify types of boundary conditions.
The Green's function number system was proposed 
by Beck and Litkouhi in 1988
and has seen increasing use since then. The number system has been used to catalog a large collection of Green's functions and related solutions.
Although described here for solutions of the heat equation, this number system could also be used
for any phenomena described by differential equations 
such as diffusion, acoustics, electromagnetics,
fluid dynamics, etc.

The Green's function number specifies the coordinate system and the type of boundary conditions that a Green's function satisfies. The Green's function number has two parts, a letter designation followed by a number designation. The letter(s) designate the coordinate system while the numbers designate the type of boundary conditions that are satisfied.

Some of the designations for the Greens function number system are given next. Coordinate system designations include: X, Y, and Z for Cartesian coordinates; R, Z, formula_1 for cylindrical coordinates; and, RS, formula_1, formula_3 for spherical coordinates. 
Designations for several boundary conditions are given in Table 1. The zeroth boundary condition is important for identifying the presence of a coordinate boundary where no physical boundary exists, for example, far away in a semi-infinite body or at the center of a cylindrical or spherical body.

As an example, number X11 denotes the Green's function that satisfies the heat equation 
in the domain (0   x   L) for boundary conditions of type 1 (Dirichlet) 
at both boundaries x = 0 and x = L. 
Here X denotes the Cartesian coordinate and 11 denotes the type 1 boundary condition 
at both sides of the body. The boundary value problem for the X11 Green's function is given by
Here formula_5 is the thermal diffusivity (m/s) and formula_6 is the
Dirac delta function.

As another Cartesian example, number X20 denotes the Green's function in the 
semi-infinite body (formula_7) with a Neumann (type 2) boundary at x = 0. Here X 
denotes the Cartesian coordinate, 2 denotes the type 2 boundary condition 
at x = 0 and 0 denotes the zeroth type boundary condition (boundedness) at formula_8. 
The boundary value problem for the X20 Green's function is given by

As a two-dimensional example, number X10Y20 denotes the Green's function in the quarter-infinite body
(formula_7, formula_11) with a Dirichlet (type 1) boundary at x = 0
and a Neumann (type 2) boundary at y = 0. The boundary value problem for the X10Y20 Green's function is given by

As an example in the cylindrical coordinate system, number R03 denotes the Green's function 
that satisfies the heat equation in the solid cylinder (0   r   a) with a boundary condition 
of type 3 (Robin) at r = a. Here letter R denotes the cylindrical coordinate system, 
number 0 denotes the zeroth boundary condition (boundedness) at the center of the 
cylinder (r = 0), and number 3 denotes the type 3 (Robin) 
boundary condition at r = a. 
The boundary value problem for R03 Green's function is given by
Here formula_15 is thermal conductivity (W/(m K)) and formula_16 is the
heat transfer coefficient (W/(m K)).

As another example, number R10 denotes the Green's function in a large body containing a 
cylindrical void (a   r   formula_17) with a type 1 (Dirichlet) boundary condition at r = a. 
Again letter R denotes the cylindrical coordinate system, number 1 denotes the 
type 1 boundary at r = a, and number 0 denotes the type zero boundary (boundedness) 
at large values of r. The boundary value problem for the R10 Green's function is given by

As a two dimensional example, number R01formula_1900 denotes the Green's function in a
solid cylinder with angular dependence, with a type 1 (Dirichlet) boundary condition at r = a. 
Here letter formula_19 denotes the angular coordinate, and numbers 00 denote the 
type zero boundaries for angle; here no physical boundary takes the form of the periodic boundary
condition. The boundary value problem for the R01formula_1900 Green's function is given by

As an example in the spherical coordinate system, number RS02 denotes the Green's function 
for a solid sphere (0   r   b ) with a type 2 (Neumann) 
boundary condition at r = b. 
Here letters RS denote the radial-spherical coordinate system, number 0 denotes 
the zeroth boundary condition (boundedness) at r=0, and number 2 denotes the type 2 
boundary at r = b. The boundary value problem for the RS02 Green's function is given by
