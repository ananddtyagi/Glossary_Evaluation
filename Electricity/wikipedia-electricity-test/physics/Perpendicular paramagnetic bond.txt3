Perpendicular paramagnetic bond

A perpendicular paramagnetic bond is a type of chemical bond (in contrast to covalent or ionic bonds) that does not exist under normal, atmospheric conditions. Such a phenomenon was first hypothesized through simulation to exist in the atmospheres of white dwarf stars whose magnetic fields, on the order of 10 teslas, allow such interactions to exist. Normally, at such intense temperatures as those near a white dwarf, more common molecular bonds cannot form and existing ones decompose.
