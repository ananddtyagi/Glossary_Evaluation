Physical metallurgy

Physical metallurgy is one of the two main branches of the scientific approach to metallurgy, which considers in a systematic way the physical properties of metals and alloys. It is basically the fundamentals and applications of the theory of phase transformations in metal and alloys, as the title of classic, challenging monograph on the subject with this title . While chemical metallurgy involves the domain of reduction/oxidation of metals, physical metallurgy deals mainly with mechanical and magnetic/electric/thermal properties of metals – treated by the discipline of solid state physics. Calphad methodology, able to produce Phase diagrams which is the basis for evaluating or estimating physical properties of metals, relies on Computational thermodynamics i.e. on Chemical thermodynamics and could be considered a common and useful field for both the two sub-disciplines.
