Variable structure system

A variable structure system, or VSS, is a discontinuous nonlinear system of the form
where formula_2 is the state vector, formula_3 is the time variable, and formula_4 is a "piecewise continuous" function. Due to the "piecewise" continuity of these systems, they behave like different continuous nonlinear systems in different regions of their state space. At the boundaries of these regions, their dynamics switch abruptly. Hence, their "structure" "varies" over different parts of their state space.

The development of variable structure control depends upon methods of analyzing variable structure systems, which are special cases of hybrid dynamical systems.
