Spatial scale

In the physical sciences, spatial scale or simply scale refers to the order of magnitude of extent or size of a land area or geographical distance studied or described. 

For instance, in physics an object or phenomenon can be called microscopic if too small to be visible. In climatology, a micro-climate is a climate which might occur in a mountain, valley or near a lake shore. In statistics, a megatrend is a political, social, economical, environmental or technological trend which involves the whole planet or is supposed to last a very large amount of time. The concept is also used in geography, astronomy, and meteorology.

These divisions are somewhat arbitrary; where, on this table, "mega-" is assigned global scope, it may only apply continentally or even regionally in other contexts. The interpretations of "meso-" and "macro-" must then be adjusted accordingly.
