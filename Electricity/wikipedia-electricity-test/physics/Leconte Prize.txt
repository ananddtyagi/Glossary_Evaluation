Leconte Prize

The Leconte Prize (French: ) is a prize created in 1886 by the French Academy of Sciences to recognize important discoveries in mathematics, physics, chemistry, natural history or medicine. In recent years the prize has been awarded in the specific categories of mathematics, physics, and biology. Scientists and mathematicians of all nationalities are eligible for the award. The value of the award in the late 19th and early 20th century was ₣50,000 (at the time equivalent to ₤2,000, or US$10,000), about five times as much as the annual salary of the average professor in France. In 2001, the award was ₣20,000, in 2008, €3,000, and since 2010, €2,500.
