Notes on edge cases needed to be fixed:

1 :  {'standard': {'term': 'Absolute convergence', 'definition': 'An infinite series of numbers is said to converge absolutely (or to be absolutely convergent) if the sum of the absolute values of the summands is finite.

Basically need to fix the issue with equations. In his system, he just cuts it at "as follows" but the questions becomes how to evaluate the equations and the latex.
